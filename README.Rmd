# {AAGIThemes} AAGI Branding for R Graphical and Tabular Outputs <img align="right" src="man/figures/logo.png">

This repository contains the code for the R package {AAGIThemes}, which once installed in your R session (local or RStudio Server), provides helper functions for creating and exporting graphics created in R with a unified style that follows the AAGI brand guidelines.

The goal of {AAGIThemes} is to provide easy to use theming of R graphics for AAGI team members.
Following AAGI's brand guidelines, AAGI colours are used where applicable and the font defaults to Proxima Nova.
The resulting graphs, plots and charts feature a x and y axis that meet at 0 with no gridlines, but these can optionally be set to appear.

## Installation instructions

### Note for Linux Users

If you are using Linux, you will likely need to install several system-level libraries, {pak} will do it's best to install most of them but some may not be installable this way.
For NECTAR with a fresh Ubuntu image, you can use the following command to install system libraries to install {pak} and then {AAGIThemes}.
In your Linux terminal (not your R console, the "terminal" tab in RStudio should do here in most cases) type:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install libxml2 libmagick++-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libcairo2-dev gsfonts pandoc libcairo2-dev libfontconfig1-dev libfreetype6-dev pandoc libmagick++-dev gsfonts libtiff-dev librsvg2-dev libgdal-dev gdal-bin libgeos-dev libproj-dev libsqlite3-dev libfribidi-dev libharfbuzz-dev libudunits2-dev libxml2-dev ttf-mscorefonts-installer
```

You can install {AAGIThemes} like so in your R session:

```r
o <- options() # store default options

options(pkg.build_vignettes = TRUE)
if (!require("pak"))
  install.packages("pak")

pak::pak("AAGI-Org-AU-Public/AAGIThemes", dependencies = TRUE)

options(o) # restore default options
```

## Quick start

Following are some quick examples of {AAGIThemes} functionality.
However, you may wish to browse the vignette for a more detailed look at what the package offers using:

```r
vignette("Cookbook", package = "AAGIThemes")
```

### Create Tabular Outputs

{AAGIThemes} provides [{flextable}](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/) and [{gt}](https://gt.rstudio.com) themes suited for the AAGI style that works in HTML and Word document outputs.

#### Creating Themed {flextable} Outputs

You can use it like so with {flextable}.

```{r ft-tabular, eval=FALSE}
library(AAGIThemes)
library(dplyr)
library(flextable)

flextable(head(airquality)) |>
  mutate(`Month Name` = "May") |>
  theme_ft_aagi()
```

### Plots and graphs

{AAGIThemes} provides several functions to assist users in creating plots, charts and graphs with a more unified AAGI style.

For creating standalone graphs using R's base library there are:

  * `barplot_aagi()`,

  * `boxplot_aagi()`,

  * `hist_aagi()`, and

  * `plot_aagi()`.

#### Using the basic plot functions

Example of how the base graphics functionality with AAGI style pre-applied is used:

```{r boxplot_aagi, fig.cap="An example plot illustrating the use of AAGIThemes with R's base plot capabilities."}
library(AAGIThemes)
boxplot_aagi(decrease ~ treatment,
  data = OrchardSprays,
  xlab = "treatment",
  ylab = "decrease"
)
```

See the respective function's help files and the {AAGIThemes} cookbook for more examples and documentation.

#### Using With {ggplot2}

The function `theme_aagi()` is provided to apply a unified style for creating AAGI themed plots, charts and graphs using {ggplot2}.
The function is very basic and provides only one parameter, `base_size`, which is used to set the font size (in points) used in the resulting figure.
No adjustments are made by the type of graph being produced, so you may wish to add grid lines or change the colour palette that is used to alter point or line colours in your graph.

Example of how `theme_aagi()` is used in a standard {ggplot2} workflow:

```{r theme_aagi_ggboxplot, fig.cap="An example plot illustrating the use of AAGIThemes with ggplot2."}
library(AAGIThemes)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = OrchardSprays, aes(x = treatment, y = decrease)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 120, by = 20)) +
  theme_aagi()
```

### Maps

Example of a map made with {ggplot2} and {AAGIThemes}.

```{r theme_aagi_map, fig.cap="An example map illustrating the use of AAGIThemes with ggplot2."}
library(AAGIThemes)
library(AAGIPalettes)
library(ggplot2)
library(ozmaps)

sf_oz <- ozmap_data("states")

ggplot(sf_oz, aes(fill = NAME)) +
  geom_sf() +
  coord_sf(crs = "+proj=lcc +lon_0=135 +lat_0=-30 +lat_1=-10 +lat_2=-45 +datum=WGS84") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = unname(aagi_colours)) +
  theme_aag()
```
