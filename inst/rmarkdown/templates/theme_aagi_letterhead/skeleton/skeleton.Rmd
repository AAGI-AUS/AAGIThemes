## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Plot facet colours

By default the plot facet colours will match the blue theme but you can change this if you like using `theme_aagi(colourway = "your color")` in your {ggplot2} plots.

## Including Page Breaks

You can include page breaks using `\newpage` within your document at any point you wish to have a new page follow.
