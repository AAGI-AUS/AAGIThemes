\usage{
barplot_aagi(height, col = "AAGI Black", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{height}{Either a vector or matrix of values describing the bars which
make up the plot.  If height is a vector, the plot consists of a sequence
of rectangular bars with heights given by the values in the vector.  If
height is a matrix and beside is \code{FALSE} then each bar of the plot
corresponds to a column of height, with the values in the column giving the
heights of stacked sub-bars making up the bar.  If height is a matrix and
beside is \code{TRUE}, then the values in each column are juxtaposed rather than
stacked.}

\item{col}{Colour to use as fill for bars  Defaults to "AAGI Black", a very
dark grey.  Can be supplied as a named AAGI colour; \emph{e.g.}, "AAGI Black";
a named colour, "black"; or a hexadecimal code, "#414042".}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to methods, such as graphical parameters
(see \code{\link[graphics:par]{graphics::par()}}).}
